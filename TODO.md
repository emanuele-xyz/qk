# TODOs

[]: build fullscreen quad mesh and use it for WBOIT composite pass
[]: implement table data structure for textures and meshes, instead of using raw std::vectors
[]: log the amount of samplers stored into the samplers cache
[]: Add the possibility of selecting which texture to use for the albedo of objects from the editor
[]: for not fully opaque objects, should we try rendering first front faces and then back faces?
