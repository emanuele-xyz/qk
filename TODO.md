# TODOs

[]: we should run the gizmo pass after the opaque objects pass but before the transparent objects pass?
[]: add flag to disable gizmo rendering
[]: use a single structured buffer for all the lights
[]: use a single shader for object and gizmo pass
[]: add support for flat rendering, just using the albedo color and no lighting
